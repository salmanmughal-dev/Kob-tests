Comprehensive Testing Suite for

This repository houses the complete testing infrastructure for Product Kob-INC Alpha, a robust, multi-portal ecommerce ecosystem designed to serve diverse user roles and customer-facing interfaces. **You can use these tests to run directly by importing them to QASA software** which includes:

- **Customer Portal**: Web/mobile interfaces for product browsing, cart management, checkout, and order tracking.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Backend UI for inventory management, user roles, analytics, and order fulfillment.
- **Vendor Portal**: Interface for third-party sellers to manage listings, orders, and payments.
- **Support Portal**: Customer service tools for ticket management and live chat.
- **Mobile Apps**: iOS/Android applications with feature parity to the web platform.

### **About This Testing Repository**

This repository contains **all automated and manual test artifacts** ensuring the reliability, security, and performance of the platform. Key components include:

1. **Test Types**

   - **Unit Tests**: Core business logic (e.g., pricing calculators, cart logic).
   - **Integration Tests**: API endpoints, payment gateways (Stripe/PayPal), and third-party service integrations.
   - **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: User journeys across portals (e.g., "Guest Checkout Flow," "Vendor Product Upload").
   - **Performance Tests**: Load testing for peak traffic scenarios (e.g., Black Friday simulations).
   - **Security Tests**: OWASP Top 10 vulnerability scans and PCI-DSS compliance checks.

2. **Tech Stack**

   - **Frameworks**: Jest (unit), Cypress (E2E), Postman/Newman (API), JMeter (performance).
   - **Tools**: Selenium Grid (cross-browser), Applitools (visual regression), SonarQube (code quality).
   - **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions/Jenkins pipelines with automated test execution on PRs and deployments.

3. **Key Features**

   - **Cross-Browser/Device Testing**: 200+ browser/OS combinations via Sauce Labs/BrowserStack.
   - **Accessibility Audits**: WCAG 2.1 compliance checks using Axe-core.
   - **Mobile Testing**: Real-device cloud testing via Firebase Test Lab.
   - **API Contract Testing**: OpenAPI/Swagger validation for microservices.
   - **Data Integrity Tests**: Database consistency checks (e.g., order → payment → inventory sync).

4. **Test Structure**

5. **Documentation**
   - `TEST_STRATEGY.md`: Overview of testing pyramid and risk-based prioritization.
   - `ONBOARDING.md`: Guide for adding new tests (with portal-specific templates).
   - `BUG_TRIAGE.md`: Process for replicating/filing issues from failed tests.

### **Why This Matters**

- **Zero Downtime**: Tests prevent regressions during 50+ daily deployments.
- **Global Scale**: Validates platform behavior across 15+ languages/currencies.
- **Compliance**: Ensures GDPR (data privacy) and PCI-DSS (payment security) adherence.
- **Performance Guardrails**: Maintains sub-2s page load times under 10k concurrent users.

### **Getting Started**

1. **Run Tests Locally**:
   ```bash
   # E2E tests for customer portal
   npm run test:e2e:customer
   # Security scan
   npm run test:security
   ```
2. **View Reports**:
   - Cypress Dashboard: `https://dashboard.cypress.io/projects/[ID]`
   - SonarQube: `https://sonar.[company].com`
